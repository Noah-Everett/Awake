# **Awake**
Application to keep mac awake while in clam shell mode (like [Amphetamine](https://www.google.com/search?q=amphetimine+app+store&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS996US996&oq=amphetimine+app+store&aqs=chrome..69i57.3334j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Amphetamine%20on%20the,com%20%E2%80%BA%20app%20%E2%80%BA%20amphetamine)).

## **Usage**
To install Awake you will need [CMake](https://cmake.org/). I recommend installing CMake via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Installing Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

Installing CMake: `brew install --cask cmake`
